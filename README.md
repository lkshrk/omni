# Omni

Portable tool, dotfile, and AI-agent resource management for developer machines.

Omni keeps tools and dotfiles portable through its JSON config. AI-agent
packages, skills, MCP servers, plugins, and marketplaces live in Microsoft APM;
Omni provides the shared CLI/TUI workflows over them.

> Omni is early-stage software. Review plans and dry-run output before using it
> on important machines.

## Install

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lkshrk/omni/main/scripts/linux-install.sh | bash
```

The script installs only `omni`; dotfile sync also needs GNU Stow. Homebrew,
Linux packages, release archives, and destination overrides are covered in the
[installation guide](docs/installation.md).

## Start

```sh
omni
```

CLI-only setup:

```sh
omni bootstrap
omni doctor
omni reconcile
```

Before broad repairs, read the [Safety Model](docs/safety.md). To move a
pre-APM host into APM, preview its manifest, write the verified host template,
then sync it:

```sh
omni agents migrate --host <name>
omni agents migrate --host <name> --write
omni agents sync
```

The Agents view checks package updates on startup; press `R` to check again.
Use `omni agents outdated` for a read-only CLI check and `omni agents update`
to apply updates. Artifacts installed outside APM are listed by
`omni agents drift` and under `Not managed by APM` in the Agents view; record a
deliberate one with `omni agents ignore`. Ownership, migration, and Doctor
behavior are covered in the [Agents guide](docs/agents.md).
